Bizmates Online Exam
By Marielle Lourdes Tenerife

Nowadays, tourists are becoming fond of reading blogs. This is because the reviews and testimonials are much based from actual experiences of bloggers. This is why I incorporated my UI design in a simple blog web application named #TravelWithMarielle. My design is simple yet straightforward, making it easy for tourists to access information & weather forecasts. I believe that preparing for a travel is a lot, because I, myself love to travel to different countries and the last thing tourists want is some complicated website. So, I put myself in the shoes of the tourists while making this application. #TravelWithMarielle simply aims to make connection with co-tourists in traveling the different cities of Japan in a way that is simple, straightforward yet educational.
